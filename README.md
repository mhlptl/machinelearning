# Machine Learning Repository

This repository is used to track my progress as I teach myself machine learning concepts and algorithms.

The modules I am using can be installed via *pip install -r requirements.txt*. I highly recommend using a python virtual environment when installing the modules.

## Learning Algorithms

The different types of algorithms are broken up into sections by their approach

### Supervised Learning

- Perceptrons
