# Perceptrons

This is a Supervised Learning algorithm which is used for binary classification. Using multiple pereceptrons can allow for multiple classifications.

The perceptron classifies a misclassification as *[ -y * (X.W) > 0 ]*, which is if the models prediction is not the same as the label (y value) provided.

## Datasets Used

- Iris Flower Dataset (I had modified it to remove the third flower)
